## **4\. Cost Structure & Unit Economics**

| Item | Current | Target |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| API & infra COGS | 85 % | 60 % |
| Copy cost (per token) | USD 0.08 | USD 0.05 |
| Image cost (per image) | USD 0.20 | USD 0.08 |
| Telco-resale margin | \- % | 20 % gross |
| API-resale margin | \- % | 30 % gross |

CAC estimates pending first marketing campaigns; assumed RM 600 / customer pre-funding, RM 420 post-funding.

#### **Cost Optimization Strategies**

To achieve the **60 % COGS** target and reduce per-unit costs, we will implement the following systematic measures:

1. **Prompt Engineering**

   * **Lean Prompts**: Continuously refine and shorten system and user prompts to use fewer tokens while preserving output quality.

   * **Template Library**: Build high-efficiency prompt templates for common ad types, cutting average token usage by 20 %.

2. **Model Selection & Migration**

   * **Cost–Performance Benchmarking**: Regularly compare closed-source vs. open-source LLMs and vision models on both cost and ad-quality metrics.

   * **Phased Switch-Over**: When an open-source model approaches within 5 % of closed-source performance, transition workloads to the lower-cost option.

3. **Evaluation Matrix & A/B Testing**

   * **Quantitative Metrics**: Set up a matrix tracking CTR, CPM, token count, inference latency, and error rates for each model/prompt variant.

   * **Automated A/B Trials**: Deploy lightweight trials on a subset of campaigns to validate cost vs. performance trade-offs in real time.

4. **Future Model Integrations**

   * **Next-Gen Engines**: Integrate emerging high-efficiency image, video and text models (e.g., open-source foundations or proprietary low-cost endpoints) as they become available.

   * **Spot & Volume Pricing**: Negotiate API and hosting volume tiers once usage hits scale (e.g., \>10 k DAU) to lock in deeper discounts.

5. **Founder-Led Execution**

   * **Eason’s Expertise**: Leveraging his statistical and algorithmic-trading background, Eason will personally oversee cost-reduction experiments, applying rigorous analytic methods and A/B test frameworks.

   * **Proven Track Record**: As Alpha Masterclass’s marketing lead, Eason drove RM 2.5 million a year in revenue—demonstrating his ability to optimize both creative performance and unit economics at scale.

## **9\. Technology & Planned RL-Driven Optimization Framework**

**Note:** The RL optimization algorithm is currently in design and validation phases. Full production rollout expected H1 2026 after A/B testing and performance tuning.

---

### **9.1 Why RL vs. Traditional Budgeting**

* **Traditional approach** relies on fixed daily budgets and a “run-time” window (often days) before delivering meaningful insights.

* **Planned RL framework** continuously learns from **total impressions** rather than elapsed days, enabling rapid budget scaling for larger advertisers without waiting for extended data collection periods.

---

### **9.2 Five-Stage Optimization Logic**

1. **Test**

   * Run a small variety of ad creatives and targeting combinations

   * Gather initial impression and CTR signals

2. **Scale**

   * Allocate increased budget to top–performing variants based on early CTR/CPM metrics

   * Use Thompson Sampling to balance exploration vs. exploitation

3. **Evergreen**

   * Maintain a set of “always-on” high-ROI ads

   * Dynamically prune underperformers and rotate in new creatives

4. **Look-alike**

   * Identify top-performing audience segments

   * Expand reach by creating look-alike audiences from high-value converters

5. **Broad Look-alike**

   * Gradually relax targeting parameters to capture wider but still profitable cohorts

   * Adjust budget tolerance upward as performance metrics remain within CTR \> 3 % and CPM \< RM 150

Each stage feeds back into the RL agent’s reward function, accelerating convergence on optimal creative-audience–budget combinations.

| Milestone | Timeline | Deliverable |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Algorithm specification | Q3 2025 | Detailed RL architecture doc & simulation results |
| Prototype build | Q4 2025 | Lightweight RL agent integrated on dev environment |
| A/B Testing | Q1 2026 | Comparative study vs. rule-based baseline (CTR/CPM) |
| Production rollout | H2 2026 | Full RL engine in live campaigns; dashboards & alerts |

---

### **9.4 Patent & IP Strategy**

* **Core claims drafted** around the five-stage, impression-driven RL framework.

* **Target filing**: October 2026\.

* **Defensibility**: Unique reward function leveraging real-time multi-arm bandit feedback on impressions, not time-based windows.

### **F. Scalable Ad-Optimisation Framework**

**Key Advantage** – Our reinforcement-learning (RL) stack optimises by **impression volume and budget** rather than elapsed days, enabling advertisers to scale spend almost immediately while maintaining target CPL/ROI.

**1\. Five-Stage RL Workflow**

| Stage | Purpose | Proprietary Edge (High-Level) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Test** | Rapidly sample creatives & targets | Lightweight multi-arm bandit to detect winners within first few hundred impressions |
| **Scale** | Push budget to early winners | Bayesian exploration / exploitation balancing |
| **Evergreen** | Maintain high-ROI assets | Auto-rotate creatives; fatigue detection |
| **Look-alike** | Expand into similar audiences | Dynamic seed-audience modelling |
| **Broad** | Widen reach at controlled CPL | Gradual parameter relaxation with guardrails |

*All stages feed back into the RL reward signal, tightening performance over time.*

**2\. Proprietary Performance Matrix**

* Multi-factor scoring (attention, engagement, cost, conversion).

* Generates a single **Performance Index** guiding bid/budget decisions.

* Detailed metric weights, cut-offs, and computations are confidential and stored server-side.

**3\. Budget-Scaling Rules (Abstracted)**

* **Tier A → B → C** promotion logic ensures only high-scoring ads receive incremental budget.

* Look-alike tiers activate once conversion-quality data passes internal confidence thresholds.

* All rule parameters are tunable via policy configuration and version-controlled.

**4\. Safeguards & Automation**

* Real-time anomaly detection: pauses spend spikes, creative errors, or CPM surges.

* Continuous A/B sandbox for new models/prompts—no production risk.

* Extensive logging allows post-hoc analysis without revealing logic externally.

**5\. IP Protection**

* Core scoring algorithm and parameter store are encrypted and executed in a closed micro-service.

* Only aggregate results (e.g., “Start” / “Pause” / “Scale”) surface to UI and partner APIs.

* Patent filing Q4 2026 covers impression-based RL workflow and performance-index methodology.
